## Theme
### Leaps and bounds

## Roles
**Julian** - Code\
**Mariothedog** - Code\
**aZaamBie** - Code and Art\
**Bailey Burnsed** - Code and Art\
**Muhammad Akbar Basit** - Audio\
**SpellMender** - Designer

## Ideas
1. Platformer-esque game where the player goes upwards instead of left/right to reach the goal. The camera doesn't shift left or right at all so there is a physical **bound**ary that the player cannot cross. Sounds repetitive and lacks story as is.

## To do
- Idea!
