## Ideas
1. Platformer-esque game where the player goes upwards instead of left/right to reach the goal. The camera doesn't shift left or right at all so there is a physical **bound**ary that the player cannot cross. Sounds repetitive and lacks story as is.

2. Game focussed entirely on **leap**ing (metaphorical boundary) where the terrain moves on its own (or the player moves at a constant speed). Could be a platformer or some other type of game.
